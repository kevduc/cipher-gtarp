TRICK OR TREAT? YOUR TREAT: AN INTRODUCTION,
AND A WARNING. I HAVE COME TO YOUR CITY FOR A
CHALLENGE. YOUR POLICE ARE SAID TO BE SOME OF
THE MOST WEATHERED IN THE NATION, THE SEVERITY
OF CRIME HERE MAKING YOU ALL EXPERTS IN WHAT
YOU DO. SO, I SEEK A BATTLE OF WITS, FOR THE PRIZE
OF NOTORIETY. IF YOU SUCCEED IN CAPTURING ME, YOU
HAVE YET ANOTHER CRIMINAL SECURED AWAY. IF YOU
FAIL, I IMMORTALISE MYSELF AS ONE OF THE GREATS.
THE TRICK? I LEAVE YOU MORE BODIES TO FIND, EACH
ONE CARVED LIKE A PIG, LEFT TO BLEED AND DIE.
IF YOU WISH TO SAVE THEM, YOU HAD BEST WORK FAST.
THE CLOCK IS TICK, AND I FIND MYSELF EAGER TO
MAKE MY MARK.
